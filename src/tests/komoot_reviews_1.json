It's very reliable and has only gotten better with the growing community of hikers and cyclists (at least in Germany). My friends, to whom I'd recommended the app, were very impressed with it and have no problems taking their children with them on tours. Quick tip: if you're using S8 (or similar) turn off Edge Lighting in display settings while using Wake-up Display during navigation. Cheers.",
